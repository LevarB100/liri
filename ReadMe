WHAT DOES THE PROJECT DO:
The purpose of this project is to make a app that once you put one of four commands 
into the app, it then performs the command. The commands and correspondingactions 
are as follows:
[---node liri.js spotify-this-song "any song"] = When this command is given the 
app will return the Artist of the song, Name of the song, Album of the 
song and the year of the song entered.

[---node liri.js concert-this "any musician"] = When this command is given the 
app will return with a list of upcoming concerts and the location of 
the concert for the musician entered into the command.

[---node liri.js movie-this "any movie"] = When this command is given the 
app will return with the Ratings, Title, Year made, Plot, and list of actors for the 
movie placed in the command.

[---node liri.js do-what-it-says] = When this command is given the 
app will do one of the three previous different actions depending 
on the command. If it has no command it will return the information
for the Britney Spear's song "hit me baby one more time".
